Here is a simple PHP table to show the month shifts marked hour-by-hour.
What it is looks like?

See the link at the end of this file.

How to use it?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Build 2 arrays as suggested at "Important".
2. Serialize both of them with the following command for a _POST transer
	$arr1 = serialize($arr1);
3. Publish a form if needed. This one will show the user a simple buttion which generated a new window with a form. Offcourse the action argument should be pointed to my file.

			<form action="shiftHoursTable.php" method="POST" target="htmlTable">
				<input type = "hidden" name = "arr1" value = '<?=$arr1?>'>
				<input type = "hidden" name = "arr3" value = '<?=$arr3?>'>
				<input type = "hidden" name = "month" value = '<?=$month?>'>
				<input type = "hidden" name = "year" value = '<?=$year?>'>
				<input type = "hidden" name = "userName" value = '<?=$user["name"]?>'>
				<input type = "hidden" name = "total" value = '<?=$sum?>'>
				<input type="submit" class="btn btn-small btn-info" value="SHOW ME HTML TABLE">
			</form>

4. If you need you can modify the weekend value with a following row
	
	if ((date("D", mktime(0,0,0,$month,$d,$year))) == "Sat")

	*in my case Sat it's a weekend and it will be painted at blue.


Inportant
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It needs to recieve 2 arrays with start and end shift values.
*values should be at DDHH format and (string) variables.
*same day start and finish values should be added at 2 arrays with the same key value
*before you transfer arrays they should be serialized.
*$_POST var names are
	arr1 - for start shifts array
	arr2 - for shift end points
	month - to show the month at the table. 
	year - to show year
	userName - for a name
	total - for a total number of shift hours per this month.

Array Examples:
[0] -> 0111 [1] -> 0217
[0] -> 0119 [1] -> 0222

Will show 2 shifts: 1st - would be 11:00 - 19:00 1/month 
		    2nd - would be 17:00 - 22:00 2/month
