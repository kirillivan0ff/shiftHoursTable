Here is a simple PHP table to show the month shifts marked hour-by-hour.
It needs to recieve 2 arrays with start and end shift values.
*values should be at DDHH format
*same day start and finish values should be added at 2 arrays with the same key value
*before you transfer arrays they should be serialized.
*$_POST var names are
	arr1 - for start shifts array
	arr2 - for shift end points
	month - to show the month at the table. 
	year - to show year
	userName - for a name
	total - for a total number of shift hours per this month.

Array Examples:
[0] -> 0111 [1] ->0217
[0] -> 0119 [1] - 0222

Will show 2 shifts: 1st - would be 11:00 - 19:00 1/month 
		    2nd - would be 17:00 - 22:00 2/month
